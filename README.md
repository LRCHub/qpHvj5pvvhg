[00:00.81] Rumbling, Rumbling, it's coming!
[00:04.37] Rumbling, Rumbling!
[00:07.22] Beware!
[00:13.23] Coming for you!
[00:20.73] 
[00:20.63] All I ever wanted to do was do right things
[00:24.48] I never wanted to be the king, I swear
[00:30.55] All I ever wanted to do was save your life
[00:34.09] I never wanted to grab a knife, I swear
[00:53.59] 
[00:40.84] I'm tearless, I'm fearless
[00:44.39] I'm burning, I'm burning
[00:47.57] You tell me what have I missed?
[00:50.88] Still wandering in the deep mist
[01:06.88] 
[00:56.58] If I lose it all, slip and fall
[01:00.10] I will never look away
[01:03.03] If I lose it all, lose it all, lose it all
[01:09.67] If I lose it all outside the wall
[01:12.97] Live to die another day
[01:16.96] I don't want anything, I'm just here to...
[01:22.81] Beware!
[01:26.31] 
[01:36.84] All I ever wanted to do was know what's out there?
[01:40.22] I refused to lose without a fight, oh, oh-yeah
[01:45.97] Oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh
[01:49.91] We're just too young, ignorant and innocent
[01:53.45] Like kids stay up all night in a tent, oh yeah
[01:57.48] How do you see me? Oh yeah
[02:00.93] Am I who I used to be?
[02:11.93] 
[02:05.69] Beware!
[02:09.19] 
[02:13.25] Nobody knows what's inside of me
[02:19.96] Nobody knows what's inside of me
[02:26.21] Nobody knows what's inside of me
[02:32.28] Ah
[02:33.28] 
[02:46.07] If I lose it all, slip and fall
[02:49.89] Will you laugh at me?
[02:52.51] If I lose it all, lose it all
[02:55.80] Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
[03:03.30] 
[02:59.02] If I lose it all, slip and fall
[03:02.59] I will never look away
[03:05.66] If I lose it all, lose it all, lose it all
[03:12.22] If I lose it all outside the wall
[03:15.43] Live to die another day
[03:19.25] I don't want anything, I'm just here to...
[03:40.25] 
[03:25.30] Beware!
[03:27.91] Rumbling, Rumbling, it's coming!
[03:29.44] Rumbling, Rumbling!
[03:31.70] Coming for you!
[03:33.14] Rumbling, Rumbling, it's coming!
[03:35.72] Rumbling, Rumbling!
