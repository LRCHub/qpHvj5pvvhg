Rumbling, rumbling
It's coming
Rumbling, rumbling
Beware!
Coming for you!

All I ever wanted to do was do right things
I never wanted to be the king
I swear

All I ever wanted to do was save your life
I never wanted to grab a knife
I swear

Tearless, fearless!
Burning, burning!
Do tell me, what have I missed?
Still wandering in the deep mist!

If I lose it all, slip and fall
I will never look away
If I lose it all, lose it all, lose it all

If I lose it all outside the wall
Live to die another day
I don't want anything, I'm just here to
Beware!
(Rumbling, rumbling, it's coming!)
(Rumbling, rumbling!)
