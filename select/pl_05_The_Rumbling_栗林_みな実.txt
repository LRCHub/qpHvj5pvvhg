Rumbling, Rumbling, it's coming
Rumbling, Rumbling
Beware
coming for you
all I ever wanted to do was do right things
I never wanted to be the king, I swear
all I ever wanted to do was save your life
I never wanted to grab a knife, I swear
tearless, fearless, burning, burning
you tell me what have I missed
still wandering in the deep mist
if I lose it all, slip and fall
I will never look away
if I lose it all, lose it all, lose it all
if I lose it all outside the wall
live to die another day
I don't want anything
I'm just here to...
Beware
all I ever wanted to do was know what's out
there
I refused to lose without a fight
we're just too young, ignorant and innocent
like kids stay up all night in a tent
how do you see me?
am I who I used to be?
Beware
nobody knows what's inside of me
nobody knows what's inside of me
nobody knows what's inside of me
if I lose it all, slip and fall... will you
laugh at me?
if I lose it all, lose it all
if I lose it all, slip and fall
I will never look away
if I lose it all, lose it all, lose it all
if I lose it all outside the wall
live to die another day
I don't want anything
I'm just here to...
Beware
Rumbling, Rumbling, it's coming
Rumbling, Rumbling
coming for you
